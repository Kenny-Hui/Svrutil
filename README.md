# SvrUtil
Bunch of useful, and occasionally weird specific tweaks and commands for Fabric-compatible server.

## Config file
This mod will work out of the box with all the commands ready to be used.  
There are a config file to modify some vanilla behavior, in that case please see [here](CONFIG.md).

## Commands
Note: These are just the default command configuration, you may optionally disable, change the required permission level or remap a command name in the [Command Config].

## Setup
You may run the `downloadOptimizedMod` gradle task if you are not using a NASA computer.

## Bugs/Suggestion
This is originated from another server-specific mod, as such things will be a bit rough around the edges and are not as polished.  
If you have any bugs or suggestions (Even just QOL one), you may open an GitHub issue [here](https://github.com/Kenny-Hui/SvrUtil/issues). Please keep things civil :)
